## From Vi to Vim, then to NeoVim
Vi is short for “visual editor” and it is available in nearly identical form on every UNIX-like system.

Vim is a Unix based text editor that is fast and efficient as it can be run through a terminal. Vim is also commonly referred to Vi as the terms are interchangeable and both terms usually refer to Vim.

NeoVim is a refactor of Vim, primarily a more maintainable and extensible command-line interface (CLI) application, better support for asynchronous plugin execution and built-in terminal emulation.
